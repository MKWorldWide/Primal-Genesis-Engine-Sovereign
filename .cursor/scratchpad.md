*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (ðŸŽ¯) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (âš¡) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ 95% confidence â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ Chain of thought analysis â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

Cross-reference with @memories.md and @lessons-learned.md for context and best practices.`

Understanding:
1. CloudFront distribution configuration complete
2. GitHub Actions pipeline implemented
3. Health checks and validation in place
4. Deployment automation ready
5. API Gateway fully configured for Athena-Sunny communication

Questions:
1. âœ“ What metrics should trigger Athena's upgrade detection?
   - Performance metrics, error rates, and system health
2. âœ“ What are the rollback thresholds for failed deployments?
   - Any failed health check or deployment verification
3. âœ“ What security validations are required pre-deployment?
   - CodeQL analysis and comprehensive testing
4. âœ“ What post-deployment checks should Sunny perform?
   - CloudFront status, API endpoints, performance metrics
5. âœ“ How should Athena authenticate with the API?
   - IAM authentication and API key validation
