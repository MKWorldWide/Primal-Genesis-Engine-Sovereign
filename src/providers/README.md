# Providers Directory ðŸ“¦

This directory contains React Context providers that manage global state and functionality for the application. Each provider is designed with quantum documentation and follows the Prime Directives for optimal system governance.

## Core Providers

### VoiceProvider
- **Purpose**: Manages voice recording state, permissions, and processing
- **Key Features**:
  - Voice recording state management
  - Microphone permission handling
  - Audio processing and analytics
  - Error tracking and recovery
- **Usage**:
  ```tsx
  <VoiceProvider>
    <VoiceRecorder />
    <VoiceStatus />
  </VoiceProvider>
  ```
- **Dependencies**:
  - React Context API
  - AnalyticsService
  - MediaRecorder API

### ChatProvider
- **Purpose**: Manages chat threads, messages, and user preferences
- **Key Features**:
  - Thread management (create, update, delete)
  - Message handling
  - User preferences
  - Processing state
- **Usage**:

  <ChatProvider>
    <Chat />
    <ThreadList />
  </ChatProvider>
  ```
- **Dependencies**:
  - React Context API
  - SovereignService
  - Chat types

## Integration

Providers can be composed together to provide comprehensive functionality:

```tsx
<VoiceProvider>
  <ChatProvider>
    <App />
  </ChatProvider>
</VoiceProvider>
```

## Best Practices

1. **State Management**
   - Use memoization for context values
   - Implement proper cleanup in effects
   - Handle errors gracefully

2. **Performance**
   - Minimize re-renders with useMemo/useCallback
   - Implement proper dependency arrays
   - Clean up resources on unmount

3. **Security**
   - Handle permissions securely
   - Validate user input
   - Protect sensitive data

4. **Accessibility**
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Support keyboard navigation
   - Include ARIA attributes

## Documentation

Each provider includes quantum documentation with:
- Cross-references to Prime Directives
- Links to @memories.md and @lessons-learned.md
- Usage examples
- Performance notes
- Security considerations
- Accessibility guidelines

## Self-Upgrade Protocol

Providers automatically update their documentation through the quantum documentation system. Changes are tracked in:
- @memories.md for development history
- @lessons-learned.md for insights
- @scratchpad.md for active development
