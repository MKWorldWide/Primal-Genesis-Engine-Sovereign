# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** February 12, 2025

Thank you for using **Primal Genesis Engine: Sovereign (PGES)**, part of the MKWorldWide initiative. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and share information when you interact with our services.

## 1. Information We Collect

1. **Authentication Data**  
   - We integrate with third-party identity providers (e.g., Amazon) to verify user identity.  
   - This may include unique identifiers, email addresses, and basic profile information provided by the third-party provider.

2. **Usage Data**  
   - When you use our services, we may automatically collect certain data such as device information, IP addresses, browser type, and usage statistics (e.g., timestamps, page views, interactions).

3. **Voice and Chat Data**  
   - If you use the voice interface (Lex, Polly), we may collect audio input and transcripts for processing commands and responses. We do not store these transcripts beyond what is necessary for the service to function.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

1. **Service Provision**  
   - We use collected data to authenticate users, process voice commands, generate text-to-speech responses, and provide overall system functionality.

2. **Improvement and Development**  
   - We analyze anonymized usage metrics to improve system performance, implement new features, and enhance security.

3. **Security and Compliance**  
   - We may use data to detect, prevent, or investigate security breaches, fraud, and other abuses or illegal activities.

## 3. How We Share Your Information

1. **Third-Party Services**  
   - We may share data with AWS (e.g., S3, Lex, Polly, Cognito) and other service providers strictly to enable features like hosting, authentication, voice processing, and analytics.

2. **Legal Requirements**  
   - We may disclose your information to comply with any applicable law, regulation, or governmental request, or to protect our rights or the safety of others.

3. **Business Transfers**  
   - In the event of a merger, acquisition, or other significant transaction, user information may be transferred as part of that deal.

## 4. Data Retention

- We retain your personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes stated in this policy or as required by law. Audio data (voice commands) may be stored temporarily for processing but is not retained indefinitely.

## 5. Security

- We use AWS’s infrastructure, which follows industry-standard security measures (encryption, access controls, etc.) to protect your data.

## 6. Children’s Privacy

- Our services are not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 7. Your Choices

- You can revoke access at any time by disabling third-party login providers (e.g., in your Amazon account settings).  
- You may also contact us to request data deletion or to inquire about specific data practices.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

- We may update this policy from time to time. Significant changes will be posted, and we will indicate the last update date at the top.
