## Breaking Changes

### 1. Python Version
- Minimum Python version is now 3.9 (was previously not strictly enforced)
- Tested with Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11

### 2. Development Dependencies
- Updated development dependencies to their latest compatible versions
- Added new development dependencies for testing and documentation

## Upgrade Instructions

1. **Update Python Version**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed
   - Update your virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv --upgrade
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     pip install -e .[dev]
     ```

2. **Update Development Tools**
   - Install pre-commit hooks:
     ```bash
     pre-commit install
     ```

3. **CI/CD Updates**
   - The new CI workflow will be automatically used for all new commits
   - Old workflow files have been archived with a .backup extension

## Known Issues and Workarounds

1. **Dependency Conflicts**
   - If you encounter dependency conflicts, try:
     ```bash
     pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Test Failures**
   - Some tests might fail due to environment differences
   - Check the CI logs for detailed error messages

## Future Improvements

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Consider migrating to Poetry for better dependency management

2. **Documentation**
   - Add more examples and tutorials
   - Improve API documentation

3. **Testing**
   - Increase test coverage
   - Add integration tests
   - Add performance benchmarks

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback the changes:

1. Revert the Git commit with the changes
2. Restore any backup files (with .backup extension)
3. Delete the newly added files
4. Update the CI/CD settings in GitHub if needed
